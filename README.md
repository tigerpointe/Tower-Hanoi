Python requires the pynput module to capture keypress input events.

```
pip install pynput
```

When the game is started, keypress input events are not passed onto the system.  Save and exit the game before using other programs.

The PowerShell script MUST be started from a real console window, not an ISE, because keypress detection is used.
